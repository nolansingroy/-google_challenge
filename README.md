# google_challenge Group Project 

# Purpose: 

Develop an application that will impact minneapolis for the better. Utilizing techniques that was learned throughout the 
Grow with google Web Specialist Course, like service worker and IndexDB. 
 A resource/ pay it forward minneapolis application .. due to recent changes in the Housing Urban Development budget 2017 july signed by trump, the HUD will give Public Housing Authorities a lot less money to provide section 8 vouchers, thus a potential result of this bill would be longer waiting list for section8 and more people who can not afford minneapolis market rate rent 
 to live on the streets or in shelters. 
 
 
# Description:

When deciding to build this application my team listed out some common problems that we see on a daily basis that minneapolis suffers from. This Application will be a npm ready web application that will allow the homeless to connect to shelter outreach programs, and other programs like free food donations, in-app donations from a karma user to the verified homeless person.  
A karma user could be anyone on the application who wishes to send money to the homeless person or just person in need 
If homeless they must have a shelter verification form posted to their account.

# Idea:
The Idea is that most homeless or low income have government assist android phone inwhich they use on a daily basis. These phones for the most part are capable of accessing a web application on the chrome browser inwhich they may also download to the phone as a native app. 

# Technologies: 

Here we will start off using html bootstrap css, and knockout.js Model view view model, but to build our package system but eventually upgrade to python flask to allow for oauth2 credentials.
